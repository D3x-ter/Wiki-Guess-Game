# Wiki-Guess-Game

Hello there!

This is my first ever try at coding with Python. Any feedbacks will be appreciated ;)

This game is absolutely useless. It is based on what I used to play with some friends. Here are the rules:

1. Choose 2 random words
2. Go to the wikipedia page of your first word
3. Find a way to reach the page of your second word only by using the links on the page
(Kind of links like dictionary, index etc is forbidden)

As this is an automated tool, we can give him some hint words to help him find his way (They cannot be used more than once)


Things that could be implemented:
- Automatically choose 2 Random words from a list
- Limit the number of hint words the user can input 
- Eventually make a score board that could ggive more points if you give less hints
- A function to automatically delete this useless code et clean the console and get more sleep-time instead ;)


Best
